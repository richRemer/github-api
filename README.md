Node.js library providing an object-oriented interface for the GitHub REST API
with full `async` support.  While originally surveying the landscape, I came
across [github-tools/github](https://github.com/github-tools/github), which is
being deprecated.  This project recommends switching to the official GitHub
[octokit/octokit.js](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js) project, which is
very robust, but ultimately did not provide an interface I was happy with.
